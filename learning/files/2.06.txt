Relational and Logical Operators in C:

**Relational Operators:**

In C programming, relational operators are used to compare two values. They return either true (1) or false (0) based on the comparison result. Common relational operators include:

- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)

Example:
```c
int a = 5, b = 8;
if (a < b) {
    // Code block executed if a is less than b
}
```

**Logical Operators:**

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (true or false). The three main logical operators in C are:

- `&&` (Logical AND)
- `||` (Logical OR)
- `!` (Logical NOT)

Example:
```c
int x = 5, y = 10;
if (x > 0 && y > 0) {
    // Code block executed if both x and y are greater than 0
}
```

**Combining Operators:**

Relational and logical operators can be combined to form complex conditions. Parentheses are used to control the order of evaluation.

Example:
```c
int num = 15;
if (num >= 10 && (num % 2 == 1)) {
    // Code block executed if num is greater than or equal to 10 and is an odd number
}
```

Understanding relational and logical operators is fundamental for implementing decision-making structures and controlling the flow of a program based on conditions. They are extensively used in constructs like if statements and loops to create efficient and expressive code.
