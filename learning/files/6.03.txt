ARRAY OF STRUCTURES

In C programming, an array of structures is a data structure that allows you to store and manipulate multiple instances of a structure in a contiguous block of memory. Each element of the array represents an individual structure, and you can access and modify the members of each structure using array indexing. Here, we'll explore the concept of an array of structures with examples.

### Array of Structures Basics:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float gpa;
};

int main() {
    // Declare an array of structures
    struct Student students[3];

    // Initialize the array elements
    strcpy(students[0].name, "Alice");
    students[0].age = 20;
    students[0].gpa = 3.8;

    strcpy(students[1].name, "Bob");
    students[1].age = 21;
    students[1].gpa = 3.5;

    strcpy(students[2].name, "Charlie");
    students[2].age = 19;
    students[2].gpa = 4.0;

    // Access and display the array elements
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("Student %d:\n", i + 1);
        printf("Name: %s\n", students[i].name);
        printf("Age: %d\n", students[i].age);
        printf("GPA: %f\n", students[i].gpa);
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a structure `Student` is defined with members `name`, `age`, and `gpa`. An array of structures `students` is declared, and individual elements of the array are initialized with student information. The array elements are accessed using array indexing in a loop to display the student details.

### Array of Structures with Function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

// Function to initialize an array of structures
void initializePoints(struct Point arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i].x = i + 1;
        arr[i].y = 2 * (i + 1);
    }
}

// Function to display an array of structures
void displayPoints(struct Point arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("Point %d: (%d, %d)\n", i + 1, arr[i].x, arr[i].y);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Declare an array of structures
    struct Point points[5];

    // Initialize and display the array of structures
    initializePoints(points, 5);
    displayPoints(points, 5);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a structure `Point` is defined with members `x` and `y`. Functions `initializePoints` and `displayPoints` are created to initialize and display an array of structures, respectively. The main function declares an array of structures and calls these functions to demonstrate their usage.

### Use Cases:

1. **Database Records:**
   - Storing records of entities in a database, where each structure represents a record.

2. **Geometric Shapes:**
   - Representing geometric shapes or coordinates with each structure element storing the information for a point or shape.

3. **Employee Information:**
   - Storing information about employees, where each structure element represents an employee's details.

### Best Practices:

1. **Consistent Initialization:**
   - Ensure that each element of the array of structures is consistently initialized to avoid undefined behavior.

2. **Array Bounds Checking:**
   - Be cautious with array bounds to prevent accessing or modifying memory outside the allocated space.

3. **Modular Design:**
   - Consider organizing code with functions to initialize, manipulate, and display array elements for better maintainability.

4. **Memory Efficiency:**
   - Be aware of the memory usage when dealing with large arrays of structures, especially in resource-constrained environments.

An array of structures in C is a versatile data structure that allows for the organized storage and manipulation of multiple instances of a structure. Proper understanding of array indexing and structure member access is essential for efficiently working with arrays of structures.
