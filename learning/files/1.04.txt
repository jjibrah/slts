The for Statement:

The for statement in C is a robust loop control structure designed for repetitive execution of a code block a specific number of times. Its syntax consists of three main components:

Initialization:
Executed only once at the start, it initializes loop control variable(s).

Condition:
Evaluated before each iteration. If true, the code inside the loop is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates.

Update:
Executed after each iteration, typically incrementing or decrementing the loop control variable(s).

Code Block:
The block of code within the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition remains true.

Understanding the for statement is essential for writing efficient and concise code, particularly when dealing with repetitive tasks or iterating over data. It serves as a powerful tool for controlling loops and streamlining code execution.

The for statement's flexibility allows customization for various requirements. Whether looping backward, using a custom step, or employing multiple loop control variables, the for statement adapts to diverse programming needs. Its versatility makes it a fundamental construct for controlling the flow of repetitive tasks in C programming.
