GETTING STARTED 

Getting started with C programming involves setting up your development environment, understanding the basic syntax, and writing a simple "Hello, World!" program. Here are the steps to get started:


1. Configuring the environment for development:

Select a C compiler (such as Xcode Command Line Tools for macOS, GCC for Linux, or MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows) according to your operating system.
To improve your development experience, think about utilizing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such Visual Studio Code, Dev-C++, or Code::Blocks.

2. Composing Your First Software:

Launch an IDE or text editor.
Make a new file (hello.c, for example) with the.c extension.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

This is a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

4. Understanding the Program:

#include <stdio.h>: This line includes the standard input/output library, allowing you to use functions like printf.

int main() { ... }: The main function is the entry point of a C program. Execution begins here.

printf("Hello, World!\n");: printf is a function used for formatted output. In this case, it prints the specified text.

return 0;: Indicates a successful execution. The value 0 is returned to the operating system.
