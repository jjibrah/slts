Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operators):

Conditional expressions, commonly known as ternary operators, provide a concise method for writing simple conditional statements in a single line. The ternary operator ? : takes three operands and returns a value based on the evaluation of a condition.

Explanation:

If the condition is true, the expression before the : is evaluated and becomes the result.
If the condition is false, the expression after the : is evaluated and becomes the result.

Use Cases:

Often used for concise assignments based on a condition.
Useful when the true/false branches involve simple expressions.

int num = -8;
int absValue = (num >= 0) ? num : -num; // If num is non-negative, absValue = num; otherwise, absValue = -num;


Advantages:

Enhances code readability for short conditional assignments.
Reduces the need for explicit if-else statements in simple scenarios.
Understanding conditional expressions is crucial for writing clean and compact code, especially in situations where a quick decision needs to be made based on a condition.
