1. Introduction to C:

Historical Context:

C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.
Developed as an evolution of the B programming language.
Became widely popular and influential, forming the basis for many other languages (e.g., C++, C#).
Procedural Programming Language:

C is often categorized as a procedural programming language, emphasizing functions and structured programming.
Focuses on step-by-step procedures or routines for solving problems.
Influences:

C has had a profound impact on the development of programming languages, including C++, Objective-C, and more.
Known for its efficiency, low-level access to memory, and direct hardware manipulation.
2. Structure of a C Program:
Basic Structure:

A C program is organized into functions, with the main() function serving as the entry point.
Functions can call each other, promoting modular and reusable code.
Statements, Expressions, and Comments:

Statements: Instructions that perform actions. Each statement ends with a semicolon (;).
Expressions: Combinations of variables, operators, and constants that evaluate to a value.
Comments: Used to annotate the code for better readability. Single-line comments start with //, and multi-line comments are enclosed between /* and */.
Compilation Process:

C programs undergo a two-step process: compilation and linking.
Compilation: Converts the human-readable source code (.c files) into object code (.obj or .o files).
Linking: Combines the object code with libraries to produce the final executable file.
Understanding these fundamental aspects lays the groundwork for learning C programming. As you progress, you'll explore data types, control flow, functions, and more, building a solid foundation for writing efficient and powerful software in C.
