    05  Arithmetic Operators:

Basic Arithmetic Operations

C programming includes several arithmetic operators to perform basic mathematical operations. The primary arithmetic operators are:

- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus - returns the remainder after division)

Example:
```c
int a = 10, b = 3, result;
result = a + b; // Addition
result = a - b; // Subtraction
result = a * b; // Multiplication
result = a / b; // Division
result = a % b; // Modulus
```

**Increment and Decrement Operators:**

C provides increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators for convenient manipulation of variables. They can be used as either prefix or postfix operators.

Example:
```c
int x = 5;
x++; // Increment x by 1 (x becomes 6)
x--; // Decrement x by 1 (x becomes 5 again)
```

**Compound Assignment Operators:**

Compound assignment operators combine an assignment with another operation, providing a concise way to update variables.

Example:
```c
int num = 10;
num += 5; // Equivalent to num = num + 5; (num becomes 15)
num *= 2; // Equivalent to num = num * 2; (num becomes 30)
```

Understanding and using arithmetic operators is essential for performing mathematical calculations in C. These operators are fundamental building blocks for creating algorithms, manipulating data, and performing various computations in C programs.
